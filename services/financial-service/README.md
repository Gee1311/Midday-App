# Financial Service API

## Overview

The Financial Service API is engineered as a distributed microservices platform, optimized for deployment on Cloudflare's edge computing infrastructure. Leveraging TypeScript for type-safe development and integrating WebAssembly (WASM) modules for compute-intensive operations, the API achieves deterministic performance across a globally distributed network of Points of Presence (PoPs). The architecture utilizes Cloudflare Workers for serverless execution, KV storage for low-latency data access, and adheres to event-driven, non-blocking I/O models facilitated by the V8 JavaScript engine to ensure high concurrency and throughput.

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Integration Layer**: Implements a modular abstraction layer facilitating seamless integration with multiple financial data providers such as Plaid, GoCardless, Teller, and Stripe. Each provider module adheres to a unified interface contract defined via TypeScript interfaces and abstract classes, allowing for extensibility and interoperability.
- **Unified Data Schema**: Utilizes consistent data models defined using JSON Schema and TypeScript types, ensuring uniform data representation across disparate provider APIs. This facilitates data integrity and simplifies downstream processing and validation.
- **Advanced Account Information Retrieval**: Offers detailed account metadata, including account hierarchies, ownership structures, and account attributes, normalized from provider-specific formats into a standardized schema.
- **Efficient Transaction Fetching**: Implements paginated transaction retrieval with support for advanced filtering parameters, such as date ranges, transaction types, categories, and merchant details. Utilizes provider APIs' bulk data endpoints where available to optimize performance and reduce latency.
- **Real-Time Balance Checking**: Provides instantaneous account balance information by leveraging WebSocket connections or provider-specific real-time APIs. Ensures data freshness and consistency through cache invalidation strategies and periodic synchronization tasks.
- **Comprehensive Institution Data**: Maintains an up-to-date repository of supported financial institutions, including metadata such as routing numbers, SWIFT codes, and institution capabilities. Data is synchronized periodically via provider APIs and stored in a distributed key-value store for low-latency access.
- **Bank Statement Retrieval**: Facilitates the retrieval and generation of bank statements in PDF format, utilizing provider APIs or synthesizing documents via templating engines and data aggregation when native support is not available.
- **Health Monitoring and Observability**: Exposes health check endpoints and integrates with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to provide real-time metrics on API performance, error rates, and provider integration statuses. Utilizes structured logging and distributed tracing for debugging and performance analysis.
- **TypeScript and WebAssembly Support**: Leverages TypeScript's advanced language features for robust application development and employs WebAssembly modules for performance-critical code paths, enabling near-native execution speeds within a JavaScript environment.
- **Edge Computing with Cloudflare Workers**: Deployed across Cloudflare's edge network, the API benefits from reduced latency and improved performance due to proximity to end-users. Utilizes Cloudflare Workers for serverless execution, KV storage for distributed data persistence, and Durable Objects for stateful interactions.
- **Webhook Event Handling**: Implements webhook listeners and dispatchers for real-time event handling, such as transaction updates or account changes, utilizing message queues and event-driven architectures to ensure reliable and scalable processing.

## Quick Start

To set up the Financial Service API in a development environment:

1. Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/SolomonAIEngineering/financial-platform-as-a-service/financial-service-api.git
cd financial-service-api
npm install

Ensure that you have Node.js (v14 or later) and npm (v6 or later) installed.

2. Configure Environment Variables:

cp .dev.vars-example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars with your API keys and configuration

Populate .dev.vars with your provider API keys, Cloudflare account details, and other necessary configurations.

3. Start the Development Server:

npm run dev

This command initializes a local development server using wrangler dev, emulating the Cloudflare Workers environment.

4. Test API Connectivity:

curl http://localhost:3002/v1/health

A successful response indicates that the API is operational.
